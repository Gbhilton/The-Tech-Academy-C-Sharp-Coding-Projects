# The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Coding-Projects

This project file location is broken up into two sub-folders. 

C# Projects houses the more intense C#, not just the tutorial and basic code. Twenty One Game is an actual working BlackJack game displayed in the console application. I also have several MVC's that I have built in this sub-folder as well. This is where I display my ability to code in C# at a more advanced level.

C# Exercises are all the C# I created in class/personal testing. I used the logic developed in this folder to help create my larger projects.
