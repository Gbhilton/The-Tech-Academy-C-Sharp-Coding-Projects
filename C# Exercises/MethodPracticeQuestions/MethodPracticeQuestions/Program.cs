            //Done. The class is called "IntegerInput" and the method is called "MathOperation".

            //2. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the one method, passing in an integer, such as 12. Then display the result to the screen.

            //IntegerInput testInput = new IntegerInput();
            //Console.WriteLine(testInput.MathOperation(12));
            //Console.ReadLine();

            //3. Add a second method to the class, with the same name, that will take in a decimal, do a different math operation to it and then return the answer as an integer.

            //IntegerInput testinput2 = new IntegerInput();
            //Console.WriteLine(testinput2.MathOperation(12.5));
            //Console.ReadLine();

            //4. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the second method, passing in a decimal. Display the result to the screen.

            //IntegerInput testinput2 = new IntegerInput();
            //Console.WriteLine(testinput2.MathOperation(12.5));
            //Console.ReadLine();

            //5. Add a third method to the class, with the same name, that will take in a string, convert it to an integer if possible, do a different math operation to it and then return the answer as an integer.

            //Done. Added a third method in the class.

            //6. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the third method, passing in a string that equates to an integer.Display the result to the screen.

            //IntegerInput testinput3 = new IntegerInput();
            //Console.WriteLine(testinput3.MathOperation("55"));
            //Console.ReadLine();

        }
    }
